pip3 install —user library *       Installs a library for Python 3 *
pip3 uninstall library              Uninstall a Python 3 library

* If you are using Linux on PythonAnywhere keep in mind that many Python libraries are already installed by
PythonAnywhere so first try to import the library in Python to see if it’s there so that you don’t install
it twice and consume your given hard disk space.

## Section 3: The Basics: Data Types

# Variables and Coding Excercise 1 & 2

Coding Excercise 1. Your First Python Excercise (E)
Assign a value to x in the first line, and print out the variable value in the second.

1 x = 1
2 print(x)
3 

Coding Excercise 2. Assign Multiple Values and Print (E)
Assign some values to variables x, y, and z.  Then insert x, y, and z inside a print() function to print out
the values of those variables.

1 x = 1
2 y = 2
3 z = 3
4 print(x, y, z)

Coding Excercise 3. Create Integers, Strings, and Floats (E)
Create three variables mood, strength, and rank and assign a string to mood, a float to strength, and an integer
to rank.  The values you assign can be anything as long as they are the correct type.

1 mood = "god"
2 strength = 52.4
3 rank = 100

Coding Excercise 4. Sum Up Numbers (E)
Assign numbers to x, y, and z.  Calculate the sum of x, y, and z in s.  Print out the value of s.

1 x = 22
2 y = 80.08
3 z = 55
4 s = x + y + z
5 print(s)
