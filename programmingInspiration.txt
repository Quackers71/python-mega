How can I learn to think on my own as a programmer?

I am a 20 year old junior computer science college student, and I feel a bit 
down because after almost a year of programming, I still can't figure out how 
to figure out problems on my own. I have Asperger's Syndrome, which is a form 
of autism that makes me "wired differently" from other people; because of this 
I also have some comprehension issues. I tend to keep relying on hints for the 
questions here for help. I would not have even figured to instill "i" or "lst" 
into the program I had to create for the answer to the problem on the screen 
if it wasn't for the hints. I keep trying out this stuff on my own in class, 
and take time for studying outside of the classroom (CodeCademy is how I got 
into programming in the first place), but even then I feel like I need a person 
explaining the step by step process of how to solve these problems to my face 
to have a chance to understand some programming questions. I know a way to get 
better at coding by myself is to practice, but I've been practicing for several 
months, and still feel like I have the same issues. I want to improve as an 
overall programmer, but I don't feel like I am doing so. I know I'm a novice 
at this stuff, but how can I practice coding in a way that'll make sure I don't 
have to feel like I need to hold someone else's hand throughout the process of 
figuring out a situation for myself?

Hi Evan. This is a very good question.

I hear you when you say you're discouraged, and I myself have been where you are. 
This feeling has been experienced by every dev who didn't begin as a 
prodigy-whiz-kid-linus-torvalds-in-training.

A super-common problem is that students/novices don't know how to ask a question 
properly. You're clearly beyond that huge barrier to communication and learning.

Q)  So, have you spent any time tackling small coding problems at codewars.com 
(my favorite), hackerrank.com, or other "challenge" websites?

There are many search-hits for "how to think like a coder". Most of those links 
are to blogs and tutorials that try very hard to demonstrate exactly what you've 
asked here today. I really like the video series at this link.
